# AI Chat Context Verification Guide

## What Was Fixed

The AI agent now maintains conversation context across multiple messages. Previously, each message was processed independently, causing the AI to "forget" previous interactions.

## Changes Made

### Backend (`supabase/functions/gemini-agent/index.ts`)
- Added `conversationHistory` parameter to accept previous messages
- Modified the API call to include full conversation history
- Maintains last 10 messages (5 user-assistant exchanges) for context

### Frontend (`AgenticInterfaceNew.tsx` and `AgenticInterface.tsx`)
- Extracts conversation history from local state
- Filters to only user/assistant messages (excludes system messages)
- Sends history with each new request to maintain context

## Manual Verification Steps

### Test Scenario 1: Basic Context Retention

1. Navigate to the Progress page (or wherever AgenticInterfaceNew is displayed)
2. Send message: "My name is John and I'm studying mathematics"
3. Wait for AI response
4. Send message: "What is my name?"
5. **Expected Result**: AI should respond with "John" or reference the name from the previous message

### Test Scenario 2: Multi-Turn Conversation

1. Send message: "I'm learning about algebra"
2. Wait for response
3. Send message: "Can you explain quadratic equations?"
4. Wait for response
5. Send message: "Give me an example based on what we just discussed"
6. **Expected Result**: AI should reference algebra and quadratic equations in its example

### Test Scenario 3: Context Window Limit

1. Have a conversation with more than 10 messages (5 exchanges)
2. Reference something from message #1 in message #12
3. **Expected Result**: AI may not remember the first message (as we limit to last 10 messages to avoid token limits)

### Test Scenario 4: Image Generation Context

1. Send message: "Create an educational diagram about the solar system"
2. Generate the image
3. Send message: "Now create another diagram showing the inner planets only"
4. **Expected Result**: AI should understand "inner planets" refers to the solar system context

### Test Scenario 5: Quick Actions with Context

1. Use a template like "Analyze My Progress"
2. Wait for response
3. Send custom message: "Based on that analysis, what should I focus on?"
4. **Expected Result**: AI should reference its previous analysis

## Debugging

If context is not maintained, check:

1. **Browser Console**: Look for errors in the network tab when sending messages
2. **Message Format**: Verify that `conversationHistory` is being sent in the request payload
3. **Edge Function Logs**: Check Supabase logs for the `gemini-agent` function
4. **Message Limit**: Ensure there are fewer than 10 messages in the history being sent

## Technical Details

### Conversation History Format

Frontend sends:
```typescript
conversationHistory: [
  { role: 'user', content: 'Hello' },
  { role: 'assistant', content: 'Hi there!' },
  { role: 'user', content: 'How are you?' }
]
```

Backend receives and prepends to new message:
```typescript
messages: [
  { role: 'system', content: systemPrompt },
  { role: 'user', content: 'Hello' },
  { role: 'assistant', content: 'Hi there!' },
  { role: 'user', content: 'How are you?' },
  { role: 'user', content: newUserMessage }
]
```

### Message Limit Rationale

We limit to the last 10 messages (5 exchanges) to:
- Prevent exceeding AI model token limits
- Maintain recent, relevant context
- Optimize API performance
- Reduce costs

## Known Limitations

1. Context is lost when:
   - User refreshes the page (conversation is not persisted)
   - User clears the conversation
   - More than 5 exchanges have occurred (oldest messages are dropped)

2. Image generation messages are included in context but images themselves are not re-sent

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
- Persistent conversation storage in Supabase
- User-adjustable context window size
- Conversation branching
- Export/import conversation history
- Conversation search and replay
