// AI Chat Context Flow Example
// This file demonstrates how conversation context is now maintained

/**
 * BEFORE THE FIX:
 * 
 * User Message 1: "My name is Alice"
 * AI sends to backend: 
 * {
 *   messages: [
 *     { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant' },
 *     { role: 'user', content: 'My name is Alice' }
 *   ]
 * }
 * AI Response 1: "Nice to meet you, Alice!"
 * 
 * User Message 2: "What's my name?"
 * AI sends to backend:
 * {
 *   messages: [
 *     { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant' },
 *     { role: 'user', content: "What's my name?" }  // No context!
 *   ]
 * }
 * AI Response 2: "I don't have that information" ❌ WRONG!

/**

 * AI sends to backend:
 * {
 *   messages: [
 *     { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant' },

 *   ],
 *   conversationHistory: []  // Empty on first message
 * }
 * AI Response 1: "Nice to meet you, Alice!"
 * 
 * User Message 2: "What's my name?"
 * AI sends to backend:
 * {
 *   messages: [
 *     { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant' },
 *     { role: 'user', content: 'My name is Alice' },      // Previous user message
 *     { role: 'assistant', content: 'Nice to meet you, Alice!' },  // Previous AI response
 *     { role: 'user', content: "What's my name?" }  // Current message
 *   ],
 *   conversationHistory: [
 *     { role: 'user', content: 'My name is Alice' },
 *     { role: 'assistant', content: 'Nice to meet you, Alice!' }
 *   ]
 * }
 * AI Response 2: "Your name is Alice" ✅ CORRECT!

/**
 * IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
 * 
 * Frontend (AgenticInterfaceNew.tsx):
 * - Maintains conversation in `messages` state array
 * - Before sending new message, extracts last 10 messages
 * - Filters out system messages
 * - Formats as { role, content } objects
 * - Sends as `conversationHistory` parameter
 * 
 * Backend (gemini-agent/index.ts):
 * - Accepts `conversationHistory` parameter
 * - Builds messages array: [system, ...history, current]
 * - Sends complete context to AI model
 * - AI model responds with full context awareness
 * 
 * BENEFITS:
 * ✅ AI remembers previous messages
 * ✅ Can answer follow-up questions
 * ✅ Maintains topic continuity
 * ✅ More natural conversations
 * ✅ Better educational assistance
 * 
 * LIMITATIONS:
 * ⚠️ Limited to last 10 messages (5 exchanges)
 * ⚠️ Context lost on page refresh
 * ⚠️ Each conversation is independent

// Example conversation flow with context:
const exampleConversation = [
  {
    user: "I'm struggling with algebra",
    ai: "I'd be happy to help you with algebra! What specific topic are you finding challenging?"
  },
  {
    user: "Quadratic equations",
    ai: "Quadratic equations can be tricky! Let's break them down. A quadratic equation has the form ax² + bx + c = 0..."
  },
  {
    user: "Can you give me an example?", // AI knows this refers to quadratic equations
    ai: "Of course! Here's an example of a quadratic equation based on what we're discussing..."
  }
];

export default exampleConversation;
